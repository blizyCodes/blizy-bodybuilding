## Key Features

This project was created as practice for MUI. It is not meant to be used for production and is a work in progress.

A user can:

- Search for exercises based on muscle group, equipment, various keywords (ie Deadlift).
- View suggested youtube videos based on a chosen exercise.

The app is using 2 different APIs to fetch <a href="https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb"> exercise data </a> and <a href="https://rapidapi.com/h0p3rwe/api/youtube-search-and-download">youtube videos </a> respectively.

## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.
